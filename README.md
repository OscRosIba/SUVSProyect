# Implementation and deployment of an electronic voting protocol

## Introduction

Electronic voting systems are becoming increasingly common, making the voting process easier for voters and/or allowing for logistical reduction in certain scenarios. This project considers a voting protocol that guarantees the desired security and integrity properties in these systems without resorting to encrypting the information. Additionally, this system allows for the verifiability of the vote by the voters, enabling them to become auditors of the process. The project proposes the implementation of a prototype of this electronic voting protocol. The development involves the distributed implementation of the different roles involved: an identification authority responsible for validating access, supervisors for each of the involved parties, and voters. This distributed implementation allows for appropriate scaling of the application in a potential deployment.

In this work, we will analyze, implement, and conduct a small deployment of the electronic voting protocol proposed by researchers Damián López and Antonio Larriba from the "Universitat Politècnica de València" in their article SUVS: Secure Unencrypted Voting Scheme.
